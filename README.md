## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Built with **React** for a fast and responsive user experience. React allows dynamic interactions and real-time updates on the platform.
- **Backend**: Developed using **Node.js** for server-side logic, APIs, and managing user sessions, ensuring a robust, scalable backend.
- **Database**: (Optional) Although this version of the app currently stores data in-memory, future updates will integrate a persistent database (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following software installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (v12 or higher) and **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **React** (included in project dependencies)
- **Git** (optional, for cloning the repository)
- **Python** (if using a Flask backend or for additional scripts)

### Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally:

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/unilifehub.git
   cd unilife
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies** for both the frontend and backend:

   For the **Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

   For the **Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory to store sensitive data such as your session secret key.
   - Example `.env` file:
     ```
     SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
     ```

4. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```
   The backend should be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

5. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend should now be running on `http://localhost:3001`.

6. **Access the application**: 
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3001` to access the UniLife platform.

### How to Use the Study Buddy Feature

- Go to the "Study Buddy" section.
- Click the "Find Buddy" button to connect with other students who have similar study interests and habits.
- The app will recommend study buddies based on courses, skills, and study preferences.



## Additional Notes

- If you run into CORS issues when connecting the frontend and backend, make sure the backend has the necessary CORS configurations in place (as discussed earlier).
- As the project grows, consider implementing a database to manage data more efficiently.
